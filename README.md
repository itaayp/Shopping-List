# Shopping-List
Shopping-List developed with VUE.JS

This is my first web page developed with vue.js.
I'm using concepts of binding data, dynamic links and classes, events handling and conditional rendering.

On the Shopping-List app, the red items means that is an important item.
And the user can also add new items or remove, by clicking on them.
